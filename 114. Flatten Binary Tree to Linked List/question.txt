question-
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.


solution-Save references to the left and right subtrees.
-Attach the left subtree to the right of the current node.
-Find the rightmost node of the new right subtree (formerly the left subtree) and attach the original right subtree to it.
-Continue the process for the next nodes in the flattened tree.
