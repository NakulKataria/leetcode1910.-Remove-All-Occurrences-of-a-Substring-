Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
Implement the MyQueue class:
void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

solution-Push Operation:Simply push the element into stack1.
-Pop Operation:If stack2 is empty, transfer all elements from stack1 to stack2. This reversal ensures that the order of elements in stack2 matches the order of a queue.
Pop the top element from stack2.
-Peek Operation:Similar to pop, but instead of removing the element from stack2, just return the top element from stack2.
-Empty:Check if both stack1 and stack2 are empty. If both are empty, the queue is empty.
