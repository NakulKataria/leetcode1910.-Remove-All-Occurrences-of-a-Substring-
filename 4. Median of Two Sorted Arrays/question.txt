question-Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

solution-Ensure binary search runs on the smaller array (for efficiency).
-Partition both arrays so that left half contains smaller elements.
-maxLeftX <= minRightY
-maxLeftY <= minRightX
-If the combined length is odd, return Math.max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY).
-If even, return the average of Math.max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY) and Math.min(minRightX, minRightY).
