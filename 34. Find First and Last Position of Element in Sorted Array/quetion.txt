question- Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].


solution-A helper function binarySearch is used. When left is true, the algorithm looks for the leftmost occurrence of the target by narrowing the range to the left.
-When left is false, the algorithm looks for the rightmost occurrence of the target by narrowing the range to the right.
-if the target is not found (nums[start] !== target), return [-1, -1].
-Otherwise, return [start, end].
