question1(16 3sumclosest)
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
Return the sum of the three integers.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

solution-sort array
-Iterate through each element as first number of the triplet.
-Use two pointers (left and right) to find the best combination with the current element.
-track athe sum that is closest to the target.


question2(18 4sum)
Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:
0 <= a, b, c, d < n
a, b, c, and d are distinct.
nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target
You may return the answer in any order.

solution-sort the array
-The first two loops (i and j) iterate through the array to pick the first two elements of the quadruplet.
-Use two pointers (left and right) to find the remaining two elements that sum to the target.
-Check and skip elements that are the same as the previous ones to ensure all quadruplets in the result are unique
