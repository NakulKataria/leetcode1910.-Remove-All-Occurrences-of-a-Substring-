Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).
Implement the MyStack class:
void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

solution-Push Operation: Simply add the element to queue1.
-Pop Operation: Transfer all elements except the last one from queue1 to queue2. Remove and return the last element from queue1, then swap queue1 and queue2.
-Top Operation: Similar to pop, but after identifying the top element, move it to queue2 and ensure all elements are swapped back.
-Empty Check:check if queue1 is empty
