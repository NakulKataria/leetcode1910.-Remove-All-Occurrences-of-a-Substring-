Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

solution-Use a pointer k to track the index where the next non-val element should go.
-Iterate through the array:If the current element is not equal to val, assign it to nums[k] and increment k.
-At the end, k will represent the count of elements not equal to val, and the first k elements of nums will contain these values. The rest of the array is irrelevant.
